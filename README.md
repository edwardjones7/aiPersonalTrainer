🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Network switch or router
Static IP addresses configured for both nodes
NAS operating system (TrueNAS, OpenMediaVault, Unraid, etc.)

Initial Setup

Connect both nodes to your network
Configure static IP addresses
Set up RAID 5 array on the primary node
Configure firewall rules
Set up shared folders and user permissions
Configure secondary node for desired services


📊 RAID 5 Configuration
The primary node uses RAID 5, which provides:

Fault Tolerance: Survives single drive failure
Read Performance: Improved read speeds through striping
Storage Efficiency: ~75-80% usable capacity (with 4 drives)
Parity Distribution: Distributed parity across all drives


⚠️ Note: RAID is not a backup. Always maintain off-site backups of critical data.


🔧 Maintenance

Monitor Drive Health: Regularly check S.M.A.R.T. data
Test Rebuilds: Periodically verify RAID rebuild capability
Update Firmware: Keep drives and system firmware current
Review Firewall Logs: Monitor for suspicious activity
